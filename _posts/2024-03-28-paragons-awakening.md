I spearheaded the brand marketing and creative direction for Paragons Awakening. My responsibilities included crafting social media captions, strategizing the social media calendar, and collaborating closely with a designer to fulfill creative and video needs. Additionally, I worked cross-functionally with the Livestreaming Operations team to broadcast a roster of elite Hearthstone players and Parallel Ambassadors. 

<p>Our goal was to inspire envy and grit to propel these participants to train and compete vigorously on Parallel TCG in preparation for the tournament day. </P>
