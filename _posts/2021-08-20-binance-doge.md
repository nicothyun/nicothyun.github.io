**Industry**: Cryptocurrency <br>
**Target Audience**: Retail Traders, Memecoin Traders, NFT Enthusiasts <br>
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks during August 2021<br>
**Value proposition**:  Let the dogs out, trade dog meme coins and earn<br>

## Background 
In 2021, Binance and crypto saw its mythical peak (thanks to Elon Musk's $BTC & $DOGE tweets!) and for the next few months, it was a blur and whirlwind of trading competitions and activation campaigns. To break the monotony of the humdrum $50,000 (in BUSD) trading activities, a duo of (rogue) [marketers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-teo-54807798/) worked around the boundaries of its internal marketing SOPs to propose and execute an activation campaign humorously targeted at dog and meme-coins traders.

## Role 
I led the project from ideation, marketing execution, cross-team collaboration to reward distribution and post-campaign ROI analysis. Inspired by the upcoming National Dog Day (August 26), I was propelled to craft and propose a tongue in cheek activation competition and its distribution strategy to ride on the 2021 summer trend of NFT and meme coin traders. Reaching out to the NFT marketing POC, I proposed to create accompanying dog-themed classic painting NFTs and coordinated marketing distribution help across SEO, Design, Communication, Local Marketing and Social Media team.

## Key Results
1. Campaign resulted in an xx% uplift in participants’ trading volume, 20K participants and a good amount of engagement from the international community. Interestingly, we found Russians users had an affinity for it.

2. Achieve direct and 200% positive ROI from marketing spend to campaign’s generated trading revenue.

3. Within 2-3 weeks, our proposed SHIB landing page ended up ranking no. 1 on SERPs for ‘buy shib’.
