## Background

It was 2015, Kisi was fresh out of its $2M seed funding round, and finding product market fit for its cloud-based access control solution.  

During my tenure, Kisi was still in the process of figuring out its target audience and its go-to-market distribution strategy. We tested and experimented with various tactics to grow the brandâ€™s lead generation. I was tasked to position Kisi as an expert in office management & security, and to grow the brand's thought leadership through content marketing channels. 


## Role

As a junior marketer in a 2-man marketing team, I managed the content calendar where I worked with the Marketing Manager, my reporting officer, to launch new content channels such as [Kisi Blog](https://www.getkisi.com/blog), [Success Stories](https://www.getkisi.com/customers) & [Kisi Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Getkisi/videos).

My responsibilities include interviewing clients to organise and produce compelling case studies - e.g. [The Farm SoHo](https://www.getkisi.com/customers/the-farm-soho), sourcing for and managing freelance writers on Upwork for weekly blog content, editing and creating written, interactive and video content (gifs, static graphic, videos etc.), content management and distribution by reaching out to thought leaders for guest blogging opportunities and curating content to promote for niche social media platforms and weekly email newsletter.
