**Industry**: Bitcoin, DeFi<br>
**Target Audience**: Bitcoin holders, DeFi yield farmer<br>
**Timeline**: September 2024 - August 2025<br>

## TLDR 

<p>Bitcoin DeFi was still early, and significant education and storytelling were needed to persuade both Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum DeFi natives to experiment with SatLayer, a Bitcoin restaking protocol.</p>
<p>I worked directly with the CEO to craft SatLayer’s overarching narrative and positioning: framing it as the foundation of a new economy built on Bitcoin, where the best asset could finally become fully programmable. To bring this to life, I developed the go-to-market strategy, brand identity, and worldbuilding framework, introducing BTCity — a metaphorical city where SatLayer and its ecosystem partners serve as the core infrastructure of a new financial order.</p>
<p>This narrative not only differentiated SatLayer from competitors but also established a cultural anchor within the community. The robot mecha mascot became a powerful symbol to make complex Bitcoin DeFi concepts more accessible, inspiring both users and partners to rally behind the vision of BTCity.</p>


## Role 

<p>
To bring the SatLayer’s narrative to life, I built storyboards and designed a robot mecha mascot, which became the cultural anchor of our brand. I continually expanded this lore through comics, animations, AI-generated videos, and episodic storytelling formats to spark curiosity and capture the imagination of our target users.

<p>Each new ecosystem partnership served as a narrative touchpoint — a chance to weave the story of BTCity expanding across chains and bridges. From Babylon Episode 1 to storytelling announcements with Sui and Berachain, these creative story arcs blended education with entertainment, making the growth of Bitcoin DeFi more engaging and accessible to both native and cross-chain communities.</P>

This approach transformed technical integrations into epic chapters in a shared world, driving deeper engagement and positioning SatLayer not just as a protocol, but as a visionary builder of the new Bitcoin economy.

## Results

Beyond TVL growth, it saw measurable community expansion and mindshare gains. 

SatLayer’s social media and community following grew consistently from 0 to 170K, with mindshare peaks around major ecosystem moments:
- 1.2% during the Babylon partnership
- 2.5% during the Sui partnership
- 5.04% ATH at TGE, amplified by the Kaito Yapper program


To sustain engagement beyond the airdrop, I spearheaded the launch of BTCity — a narrative-driven worldbuilding initiative designed to retain users, deepen cultural identity, and strengthen long-term community loyalty.
