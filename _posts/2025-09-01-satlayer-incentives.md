**Industry**: Bitcoin, DeFi<br>
**Target Audience**: Bitcoin holders, DeFi yield farmer<br>
**Timeline**: September 2024 - August 2025<br>

## TLDR 
<p>
Fresh off SatLayerâ€™s $8M pre-seed raise, I led the design and launch of the airdrop mechanics and GTM strategy to scale retail TVL and restakers ahead of TGE. By partnering with BTC LST protocols (Lombard, Solv, Bedrock), activating KOLs and liquidity providers, and running seasonal campaigns (The Great BTC Meme War, Sui City Bingo), we converted early demand into sustained growth. The program scaled TVL from 100 BTC to 3,600 BTC (~$400M) and weekly active restakers from 0 â†’ 109,946 in under 11 months.</p>


## Role 

<p>
To achieve this, we partnered with leading BTC LST protocols such as Lombard, Solv, and Bedrock, enabling Bitcoin stakers to deposit their wrapped BTC assets on SatLayer and earn points toward the airdrop.

<p>We launched with Epoch 1, capping deposits at 100 BTC ($40M) â€” the cap was filled in under two days, validating strong demand.
