hi,  this will be an evolving attempt at repository and a learning ground for my endeavors into web2 & web3 gaming. I mostly play on PC, occasionally on Nintendo Switch. 

# CURRENTLY PLAYING
- **The Sims 4 & expansions** is my comfort game. I played the sims franchise for more than a decade now and I still remember my schooling days where I had a notebook with the different worlds --- their individual lore, character traits & the story progression.  I once remembered a reddit user clamoring and calling out my OCD for drawing out the worlds and keeping tab of each stories.
