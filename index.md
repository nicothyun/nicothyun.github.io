I am a [growth marketer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nuyyuey/ "Nicole Teo on Linkedin"){:target="_blank"}. I dipped my toes in crypto, payments & e-commerce industries. Throughout the years, I picked up a variety of experiences helping startups and brands find product-market fit in 0 to 1 environment to scaling hyper user growth from 1 to 100x.

At the fundamentals, great marketing tells a story. Hence, I like to think of myself as an aspiring storyteller that combines **code, design, words, data, interative media** to tell the story of your brand and its products.

I live on the philosophy of action, where I believe [knowledge, learned through books or texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)){:target="_blank"} are best accompanied by [action and experience]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2015/11/28/travel/). 

I played competitive football/soccer through my high school to varsity years. Four years post-graduation, I picked up touch rugby and plays competitively during the summer & winter leagues. In my free time, I like playing [games]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2023/08/31/gaming/) and surfing the net absorbing useless history and mythology facts.
